# Groups the output based on the timestamp of the message.
# The output goes to date-partitioned paths (e.g., 
# s3n://bucket/topic/dt=2014-05-01, s3n://bucket/topic/dt=2014-05-02). 
# Date partitioning is particularly convenient if the output is to be consumed 
# by ETL tools such as Hive. 
# The timestamp of the message may be expressed either in seconds or 
# milliseconds, or nanoseconds since the epoch. 
# There are different date parsers configured to parse the timestamp of the
# message (Thrift/Protocol, JSON, Avro), please refer to README.md for 
# configuration details.
